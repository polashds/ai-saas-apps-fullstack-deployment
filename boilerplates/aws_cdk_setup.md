Great! Since you confirmed, here’s a quick checklist to ensure your **AWS CDK project** is correctly set up and ready for `cdk bootstrap`.

## ✅ Full Checklist for Bootstrapping Your CDK App

### 1. 📂 **Correct Project Structure**

Your CDK project should look something like this:

```
copykitt-infra/
├── bin/
│   └── copykitt-infra.ts        # Entry point
├── lib/
│   └── copykitt-infra-stack.ts  # Your CDK Stack
├── node_modules/
├── .env                         # Your secrets (not in Git)
├── package.json
├── cdk.json
├── tsconfig.json
└── ...
```

---

### 2. 📦 **Install Required Dependencies**

Run these from inside `copykitt-infra/`:

```bash
npm install              # installs all deps from package.json
npm install dotenv       # installs dotenv
npm install --save-dev @types/dotenv
```

Optional: Install AWS CDK globally if not already done:

```bash
npm install -g aws-cdk
```

---

### 3. ⚙️ **Your `.env` File**

Create a `.env` file in the root of `copykitt-infra/`:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-real-key-here
```

And access it in TypeScript like this:

```ts
import * as dotenv from "dotenv";
dotenv.config();

const apiKey = process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY;
```

---

### 4. 🚀 **Run Bootstrap**

Once all is ready:

```bash
cdk bootstrap aws://6008-1850-6695/eu-north-1
```

---

### 5. 🧹 **.gitignore Reminder**

Ensure `.env` is **not committed to Git**:

Your `.gitignore` should include:

```
.env
node_modules/
cdk.out/
```

Would you like me to check your current `copykitt-infra-stack.ts` file and show how `.env` integration can be used cleanly inside the CDK stack?
